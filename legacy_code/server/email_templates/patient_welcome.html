                <h3>How KGC Works for You:</h3>
                <p>KGC uses the plan your doctor has set for you (called Care Plan Directives, or CPDs), along with trusted Australian health information and your own preferences, to give you advice and ideas using supportive techniques.</p>

                    <li><strong>Personalised Support:</strong> Get tips and ideas tailored to your doctor's plan for your diet, exercise, and medication routine.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Motivation When You Need It:</strong> Use the special "Keep Going" button. If you're feeling stressed, tempted, or losing motivation, tapping this button will bring up your personal motivational image, a calming video, and a breathing exercise to help you refocus.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Inspiration:</strong> Find ideas for healthy recipes or new exercise routines that fit your preferences and fitness level (safely!).</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Connecting Locally:</strong> Discover local gyms, yoga studios, or personal trainers if that's something you're interested in exploring.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Daily Check-in:</strong> We'll ask you each day to quickly rate how you feel you're going with your diet, exercise/wellness routine, and medication (on a scale of 1 to 10). This helps KGC understand how to best support you and keeps your doctor informed of your progress with their care plan (CPDs).</li>
