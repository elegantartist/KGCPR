Based on the system overview you provided, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is the central data framework that enables the KGC Health Assistant to function as a personalized, adaptive service for both the KGC system and its patients.
How MCP Helps KGC (The System)
MCP acts as the nervous system for the KGC Health Assistant, allowing for sophisticated coordination and continuous improvement:
 * Intelligent Task Routing: The MCP provides the Supervisor Agent with comprehensive patient data, including keywords, sentiment, and intent from messages. This allows the Supervisor Agent to quickly and accurately route requests to the appropriate sub-agent, such as the Inspiration Machine D for diet or the E&W Support agent for exercise services.
 * Effective Model Training: The protocol is crucial for both Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL).
   * For SFT, MCP includes multi-turn conversation history (e.g., recent_chat), which trains the agent to maintain context and continuity over time.
   * For RL, MCP provides key metrics like app usage frequency, self-score improvements, and "Keep Going" button usage, which are used to calculate rewards and optimize the agent's performance to maximize patient engagement.
 * Achieving Business Objectives: By enabling deep personalization, the MCP helps the KGC system achieve its primary directive: increasing patient app usage and improving daily self-scores, which are essential for the success of the application and for demonstrating outcomes in the Mini Clinical Audit (MCA).
How MCP Helps Patients
For patients, the MCP translates into a more seamless, caring, and effective health assistant experience:
 * Deep Personalization: The MCP allows the Supervisor Agent to access a patient's entire context, including their doctor's Care Plan Directives (CPDs), recent self-scores, chat history, and stated preferences. This means the advice is never generic; it's always tailored to their specific situation.
 * Continuous and Context-Aware Conversations: By tracking short, mid, and long-term data, the MCP ensures the Supervisor Agent remembers past interactions. For example, if a patient mentions they prefer yoga over walking, the MCP stores this preference, and the agent can suggest a yoga video in a future conversation.
 * Proactive and Motivating Support: The system uses data from the MCP to offer motivating features. It can recognize progress and offer encouragement like, "You’ve been using the app for a week now, and your self-scores have improved. Keep up the good work!” It can also proactively suggest "Quick Wins" or relevant health trivia to keep the patient engaged.
 * A Seamless Experience: Patients only interact with the Supervisor Agent. The MCP works in the background to coordinate all the specialized sub-agents, presenting their combined work as a single, unified service. This creates a user-friendly experience where the patient feels they are interacting with a single entity that genuinely cares for them.
